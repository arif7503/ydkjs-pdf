# You Don't Know JS - PDF

This a PDF version of "You Don't Know JS" book by @getify.

I don't own any rights to this book.

This PDF was created from publicly available markdown files under [getify/You-Dont-Know-JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) repository.

I used `pandoc` utility to transform markdown files to PDFs.
